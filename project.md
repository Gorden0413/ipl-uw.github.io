## Human Pose Estimation
## Radar Object Detection
## Domain Adaptation
## Generation for Perception
Use large generative models (e.g. Large Language Models (LLM), Diffusion Models) to aid in perception tasks, including classification, detection and image captioning. Methods are applied in multiple applications, including:
- Human Object Interaction (HOI) Recognition
  - SOTA in HOI classification on HICO: DEFR (Detection-Free HOI Recognition), since 2021
  - SOTA in Zero-shot HOI classification: HTS (Heterogenious Teacher-Student Framework), since 2022
  - SOTA in Zero-shot HOI detection: HTS (Heterogenious Teacher-Student Framework), since 2022
- Medical Image Understanding
  - SOTA in Chest X-ray (CXR) Radiology Report Generation, MIMIC-CXR: C2C (Concept-to-Content Method for Radiology Report Generation), 2023
